# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repo.

## Branch policy (read first)

**All work happens on `production`, which is also the deploy branch.** Do not touch `main` unless explicitly asked. This supersedes `plan.txt`'s older "main = deploy" strategy — `production` is ahead of `main` and is what ships.

## What LuxeMatch is

A **shop-installed** AI jewellery platform with a full e-commerce layer. One install serves one jeweller's inventory on an in-store device. Customers browse, search by photo, try jewellery on in 2D AR, add to cart, log in via Supabase Auth email OTP (phone is still the shop-scoped customer/order identity), and order for delivery or click-and-collect. Staff unlock a back-office on the **same device** with a PIN. The cloud (Supabase, Qdrant, Cloudinary, the Python embedder) is **shared across all shops**; tenancy is enforced by `jeweller_id` on every row, payload, and folder.

Multi-jeweller "MODE B" (works without `SHOP_JEWELLER_ID`) is **not built** — `getShopJewellerId()` throws without it, and the dead `/store/[jeweller-slug]` page was removed. `plan.txt` is the canonical phase plan; `SETUP.md` covers e-commerce setup. `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api-contracts.md` are **stale** (Vercel/Gemini/old schema) — prefer `plan.txt`, this file, and the code.

## Build state

All core phases (-1→12) + e-commerce (E1–E3) are landed on `production`. Highlights:

- **Inventory intelligence (9.5)** — heuristic recs on `/jeweller/dashboard` + `/jeweller/intelligence`.
- **E-commerce** — Supabase Auth email OTP, cart, checkout, orders, multi-branch. Migrations `0002_ecommerce.sql` + `0003_security_advisor.sql`.
- **Style quiz (9)**, **analytics/smoke/vitest (10)**, **Render config + CORS lockdown (11)**, **PIN hardening (12)**.
- **Realtime** — `useMultiDeviceSync` / `useRealtimeCatalog` keep catalog + dashboard live across devices.
- **Cart + cold-boot handling** — `useAddToCart` avoids mount-time cart fetches; `/api/search/jewellery-ai` has a 45s timeout + one retry and returns `upstream_warming_up` 503 during the HF Space's ~30–90s cold boot.
- **Prod-blocker pass (P1–P3)** — cart/address helpers jeweller-scoped, demo OTP hidden in prod, migration seeder env-loaded, saved/compare on `sessionStorage`, home on real APIs, year-relative festival windows, durable PIN limits via `pin_audit_events`, tenancy guard tests.
- **Email OTP verified end-to-end** — custom SMTP set in the Supabase dashboard (dev: a personal Gmail App Password). Supabase email OTP is **8 digits**; verify route + login input accept **6–8** (`/^\d{6,8}$/`, input maxLength 8) — was hardcoded to 6, which made login impossible. `send-otp` logs the real Supabase error on failure.
- **Storefront renders real `product_images`** — saved/compare/CompareTray hydrate stored UUIDs via tenant-scoped `GET /api/products/by-ids`; collections/occasions use real APIs; `productImageUrl()`/`PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE_URL` fallback. The 12 demo products point at Cloudinary assets under `luxematch/<SHOP_JEWELLER_ID>/products/`, imported from `jewellery_search/*` via `pnpm import:cloudinary-product-images` (sequential map — see gap #6).

**NEXT:** push/deploy local `production` commits; apply `0003_security_advisor.sql` in Supabase; swap dev Gmail SMTP for a transactional provider (Resend/Brevo) + set prod `SMTP_*`; upload real per-product photos. Do **not** touch try-on/AR assets — deferred. AWS migration parked.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev / typecheck / build / lint / format[:check]   # standard workspace tasks
pnpm provision-shop          # interactive per-device install (writes SHOP_JEWELLER_ID + cookie secret + PIN hash to apps/web/.env.local)
pnpm reindex --jeweller-id=<uuid> | --all   # backfill OpenCLIP embeddings → Qdrant
pnpm seed:intelligence       # 180d synthetic views/tryons/sales (--reset-demo-history to wipe first)
pnpm rollup:intelligence     # roll signals → inventory_signals (7d buckets, 180d)
pnpm seed:ecommerce          # demo branches/customers/orders (env-loaded run-migration.mjs)
pnpm check-env               # required-env CI gate
pnpm smoke-test              # ping Supabase+Qdrant+embedder+Cloudinary+PIN (exit 1 if unreachable)
pnpm test                    # vitest — tenant PIN/cookie/rate-limit + DB/Qdrant tenancy guards
```

`reindex`, `seed:*`, `rollup:*`, `check-env`, `smoke-test`, `seed:ecommerce` all load `apps/web/.env.local` via `tsx --env-file`; new CLI scripts should too. `run-migration.mjs` seeds demo data — it does **not** apply migrations (despite the name); apply those in the Supabase SQL editor.

**Three processes for full E2E:** (1) Python embedder — `python -m uvicorn embedder:app --port 8001` from its venv (first boot pulls ~350 MB OpenCLIP weights; use `python -m uvicorn` so the venv interpreter is used); (2) `pnpm dev`; (3) cloud services (already in `.env.local`). After `next.config.ts`/workspace changes causing chunk 404s: `rm -rf apps/web/.next && pnpm dev`.

## Deployment

Deploy from `production`.

- **Web** — `luxematch-web` (`render.yaml`): Node, Next.js + Hono on Render, health `/api/health`. On the **free plan** (idle spin-down → cold-start blank kiosk; upgrade before real installs). `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` + `NODE_ENV=production` lock down CORS.
- **Embedder — NOT DEPLOYED.** `apps/embedder` is local-only (`EMBEDDER_URL=http://localhost:8001`); embeddings are backfilled via `pnpm reindex` from a dev machine. So on the deployed site the OpenCLIP routes (`/api/search/text|image|hybrid`, `POST /api/embeddings/product/:id`) have nothing to call. `luxematch-embedder` is defined in render.yaml but never deployed (roadmap P3 9b).
- **Jewellery_AI — deployed on HF** at `botivate2026-jewellery.hf.space` (repo `../Jewellery_AI`, Docker SDK Space) with its **own** Qdrant collection `jewellery_search`. It exposes `/search` etc. but **no** `/embed/*`, so it can't be `EMBEDDER_URL`. `JEWELLERY_AI_URL` points here; `/api/search/jewellery-ai` proxies to it and is the **production visual-search path** until the embedder ships.

Guides: [`docs/deployment.md`] (operator), `SETUP.md` (dev/testing), [`apps/web/.env.production.example`] (annotated env). AWS migration deferred; when it happens only env vars + `packages/cloudinary` change (see Infrastructure vendors).

## API surface

All mounted in `apps/web/app/api/[[...route]]/route.ts`. PIN-gated = `lm_pin` cookie; customer-gated = `lm_customer` cookie. CORS app-wide via `hono/cors` (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` allow-list, credentialed; prod rejects unknown origins).

## Frontend data status

Most customer pages hit real APIs (catalog, detail, try-on, cart, checkout, orders, login, collections, occasions, home featured + collections, saved/compare via by-ids).

- **`/search/image` → `/api/search/jewellery-ai`** — works in prod but returns Jewellery_AI's catalog, not this shop's.
- **`/search` text + `/style-quiz`** → embedder-dependent → broken on the deployed site until the embedder ships.
- **`/compare` + `/saved`** — `CompareContext`/`SavedItemsContext` on **`sessionStorage`** (`luxematch_compare`/`luxematch_saved`, max 4 compare). Intentional kiosk reset-between-customers; no `saved_items` table.
- **`/checkout/success`** — URL-param only; checkout sends a confirmation email when `SMTP_*` env is set.

Cart hooks (all `apps/web/hooks/use-cart.ts`): `useCart()` (full fetch — /cart, /checkout), `useAddToCart()` (POST-only — cards/detail), `useCartCount()` (global listener).

## Image storage + vector search data flow

Same flow in dev and prod; only vendor endpoints change.

**Indexing:** Jeweller uploads → Cloudinary `luxematch/<jewellerId>/<bucket>/` (returns secure_url, public_id) → (`pnpm reindex` or `POST /api/embeddings/product/:id`) fetch bytes → Python embedder `POST /embed/image` (OpenCLIP ViT-B-32/laion2b, 512-d L2-normalised) → Qdrant `luxematch_products` (point id = product_id UUID, 512-d cosine, payload {product_id, jeweller_id, slug, category, metal, occasion_tags, price_min/max, has_tryon}).

**Search:** customer photo → `POST /api/search/image` (base64) → embedder → Qdrant ANN (must-filter `jeweller_id = ctx.shopJewellerId`) → `getProductsByIds(jewellerId, ids)` → render with Cloudinary URLs. The **link** between stores is `product_id` (Qdrant point id = Supabase PK); `product_embeddings` mirrors indexed status.

**AR assets** follow the same flow: transparent PNGs under `luxematch/<jewellerId>/tryon/`, URLs in `product_tryon_assets.asset_url`; the AR engine loads at runtime from a Cloudinary URL or local `/All_jewelleries/...`.

Current image state: the 12 demo products have primary `product_images` rows pointing at real Cloudinary assets imported from `jewellery_search/*` via `pnpm import:cloudinary-product-images --source-prefix=jewellery_search --limit=12 --apply --replace-seed`. Source assets had hex public IDs and no metadata, so they were mapped **sequentially** — use per-product uploads or an explicit mapping pass for accurate catalog photography (gap #6). Don't run `pnpm reindex` unless image rows/URLs change.

## Infrastructure vendors — dev vs prod

Data flow identical; only env changes. Dev → Prod(when migrating): Cloudinary `dyrc4bo4m` → S3+CloudFront · Qdrant Cloud → self-hosted Qdrant · Supabase Postgres → RDS · local embedder → EC2/ECS GPU (same FastAPI). Migration touches only: `CLOUDINARY_*` env + `packages/cloudinary/src/index.ts` (→ S3 SDK), `QDRANT_*`, `EMBEDDER_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`. `packages/embeddings`/`packages/qdrant`/search routes are vendor-agnostic HTTP.

## Two cookies, two auth flows

| Cookie | Purpose | Signed with | TTL |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lm_pin` | Jeweller back-office | `LM_PIN_COOKIE_SECRET` (HMAC, Web Crypto) | `LM_PIN_COOKIE_TTL_SECONDS` (4h) |
| `lm_customer` | Customer account/cart/orders | same secret + `:customer` suffix | 7d |

Both HMAC-SHA-256 via `crypto.subtle` (Node + Edge safe). PIN hashing (scrypt, `scrypt$N$r$p$salt$hash`, timing-safe) is Node-only in `@luxematch/tenant/server` — **never import from middleware/Edge**.

**PIN hardening (12):** rate limit 5 fails/60s per `(jeweller_id, IP)` — **in-memory per-process Map**, resets on deploy, not multi-instance safe (revisit via `pin_audit_events` count before scaling). Every attempt audited to `pin_audit_events` (fire-and-forget). Cookie `HttpOnly`/`SameSite=Strict`/`Secure` in prod. Lock button → `POST /api/shop/lock`. Idle-lock: `apps/web/middleware.ts` re-checks TTL on every `/jeweller/*` and redirects to `/jeweller/unlock?next=…`. Multi-staff path specced in [docs/auth-readiness.md].

## Tenancy enforcement (most important invariant)

Every read/write filtered by `SHOP_JEWELLER_ID`. Check each layer:

1. **Env** — `SHOP_JEWELLER_ID` via `getShopJewellerId()`.
2. **Middleware** — `tenantMiddleware` sets `c.set('shopJewellerId', id)`; handlers read context, never the body.
3. **DB helpers** — take `jewellerId` first arg; service-role bypasses RLS so filtering is the *only* isolation. **Known exceptions** (rely on shop-scoped `lm_customer` cookie): `updateCartItem`, `removeFromCart`, `clearCart`, `getCartCount`, `getCustomerAddresses`, `upsertCustomerAddress` take only `customerId`; `getCategories`/`getCollectionProductIds` are global. Don't add new exceptions.
4. **Qdrant** — `searchByVector()` force-merges `jeweller_id` as the first must-filter; callers can't opt out. `upsertProductVector()` does NOT validate payload jeweller_id — set it correctly.
5. **Cloudinary** — folders built server-side as `luxematch/<jewellerId>/<bucket>/`; `publicIdBelongsToJeweller()` checks prefix, but `deleteAsset()` does NOT — the route must check first.
6. **PIN/customer guard** — mutations via `pinGuard`; customer routes verify `lm_customer` per-handler (no global middleware).

Applies to e-commerce too: `customers`/`cart_items`/`orders`/`branches` all carry `jeweller_id`. Same phone = different `customers` row per shop; never join customers across jewellers.

## AR engine math (don't fight the conventions)

`packages/ar-engine` is a TS port of `../jewellery-ar-service/frontend/app.js`:

- **Y-down ortho camera** — `atan2(dy,dx)+π/2` is correct without a leading negation; if mirrored, remove an extra negation, don't add one.
- **`mirrorLandmarks()` runs ONCE** before smoothing (video is CSS-mirrored, canvas isn't); twice snaps the OneEuro history.
- **Selective smoothing** — `FACE_LM_USED`(7), `HAND_LM_USED`(7), `POSE_LM_USED`(shoulders 11/12). No more.
- **Visible-bounds anchoring** — earrings PNG top-center, necklace 5% below top (skips clasp), rings/bangles visible center. Alpha-bounds scan downscales to 512px and needs CORS on the image host (else full-image fallback).
- **`renderer.ts` + `preview.ts` both delegate to `overlayMath.ts`** — put new positioning math there, not in either consumer.
- **3D** — `ARRenderer` loads GLB/GLTF via GLTFLoader (centered, longest-dim normalized) alongside PNGs; format from URL ext.
- OneEuro defaults `minCutoff=2.0, beta=0.1, dCutoff=1.0` (matches source).

## Intelligence (9.5)

`@luxematch/intelligence` is **pure, no I/O** (DB reads in `packages/db/src/intelligence.ts`; routes are thin shells). Recs: restock / review price / reduce stock / prepare for wedding/festive/gift season. Signals: `product_sales` (from "mark sold" — demandScore weights sales 8×, tryons 2.5×, views 0.25×), `product_views`, `tryon_events`, `stock_count`, prices, `INDIAN_SEASONAL_WINDOWS` (year-relative: wedding Oct–Dec, festive Sep–Nov, gift Jul–Aug). Heuristic not ML; sparse data → low confidence (high needs ≥12 products + ≥80 signals). Scoring in `packages/intelligence/src/index.ts`.

## Analytics (10)

`apps/web/lib/analytics.ts` → `trackEvent(type, {productId?, metadata?})`: fire-and-forget `navigator.sendBeacon` (falls back to `fetch keepalive`), never throws/blocks; per-tab `lm_session_id` in sessionStorage (kiosk reset). Server (`lib/api/analytics.ts`) validates `event_type` against an allowlist, attaches `jeweller_id` from ctx, writes `analytics_events`, and fans `product_view`→`product_views`, `tryon_start`→`tryon_events`. **New event type:** add to the `AnalyticsEventType` union AND the `EVENT_TYPES` array — must stay in sync. Wired: search_text, product_view, cart_add, save/unsave, compare_opened, style_quiz_completed, tryon_start/capture, order_placed.

## Realtime sync

`useMultiDeviceSync(jewellerId, cb)` subscribes to Supabase Realtime on `products`/`product_sales`/`tryon_events` (jeweller-scoped) so other devices refresh without reload; `useRealtimeCatalog` is a lighter customer-only variant. Both use `getSupabaseBrowser()` (anon key, browser-safe).

## E-commerce data model (0002)

`branches` (click-and-collect locations) · `customers` (per-jeweller, unique `(jeweller_id, phone)`) · `customer_otps` (**legacy** phone-OTP table; login now uses Supabase Auth email OTP) · `customer_addresses` · `cart_items` (unique `(customer_id, product_id)`) · `orders`/`order_items`/`order_status_history` (status placed→…→delivered/cancelled, payment snapshot). Apply via Supabase SQL editor: run `0002_ecommerce.sql` then `0003_security_advisor.sql`.

## Common pitfalls

- **`node:crypto` in middleware** — `/server` (scrypt) is Node-only, base `@luxematch/tenant` (HMAC) is Edge-safe; mixing breaks the build.
- **Server secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`** — `packages/config` enforces the split; don't reach for `process.env.X` directly.
- **Supabase joins return arrays** even for single-row relations — see `extractJewellerId()` in `packages/db/src/media.ts`.
- **Generated columns must be IMMUTABLE** — search vector uses a trigger (`products_set_search_vector_trg`), not `GENERATED ALWAYS AS`; don't revert.
- **`/api/products/manage` (PIN, richer) ≠ `/api/products` (public)** — different field sets.
- **Next.js 15 + `useSearchParams`** needs a `<Suspense>` parent (see `apps/web/app/jeweller/products/page.tsx`).
- **Product edit uses UUID** — `/jeweller/products/[id]` → `/api/products/by-id/:id`, not the slug route.
- **`pnpm build` needs `SHOP_JEWELLER_ID`** — SSR/ISR pages call DB helpers at build time.
- **Cart/orders per-customer per-jeweller** — never join customers across jewellers.
- **Saved/compare on `sessionStorage`** (intentional kiosk reset) — don't move back to localStorage without a product decision.
- **Showcase AR products prepended** — `/try-on` merges 44 hardcoded `lib/showcase-ar-assets.ts` entries with `/api/tryon/products`; real AR assets deferred, don't change this path.

## Known gaps / production blockers (priority order)

1. **Secret rotation** — old Supabase service-role, Cloudinary secret, Qdrant keys were exposed in git history / sibling scripts. `run-migration.mjs` is env-loaded now, but leaked dashboard secrets still need rotating.
2. **Push/deploy local `production` commits** — P1–P3, email OTP, Security Advisor work is committed locally only.
3. **Apply `0003_security_advisor.sql`** in Supabase SQL editor, then rerun the linter (adds explicit `service_role` policies + fixed function `search_path`; no anon/authenticated grants).
4. **OTP email on a personal Gmail (dev only)** — works E2E but Gmail caps ~500/day, spam risk, not a real sender. Switch to Resend/Brevo + verified domain before real customers. OTP is 8 digits; app accepts 6–8, don't re-narrow.
5. **Order confirmation email** — checkout sends via optional `SMTP_*` (nodemailer, separate from Supabase Auth SMTP); set in prod env, ideally same provider as #4.
6. **Product image mapping quality** — real Cloudinary images imported + displayed, but `jewellery_search/*` sources had no metadata so the 12 products were mapped sequentially. Upload per-product photos via the jeweller flow, or add an explicit mapping layer + rerun the importer. Don't touch try-on/AR.
7. **Embedder not deployed** — text search + style quiz dead on the deployed site; indexing manual. Visual search works via the HF Space proxy but isn't tenancy-scoped. Decide hosting (own HF Space / Render service / add `/embed/*` to the Jewellery_AI Space).
8. **`luxematch-web` on Render free plan** — idle spin-down = cold-start blank kiosk.
9. **Hardcoded `LUXE10` discount** — no discount table.
10. **Test coverage** — tenancy guards exist; checkout/order-email + full auth flows lack integration tests.
11. **Stale docs** — `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/api-contracts.md`, `README.md` (Gemini/Vercel/old schema); `apps/Readme.md` empty.
12. **Empty `@luxematch/ui`** — placeholder; populate or remove.
